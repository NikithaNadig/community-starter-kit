CONTRIBUTOR CODE
We recommend that you add the Markdown or text version of the Contributor Covenant to your source code repository at the root level.

Thanks to Simon Vansintjan there is an automated way to add Contributor Covenant to your project. Assuming that you have Node.js installed, simply run the following two commands from your project folder:

npm install -g covgen
covgen <nikitha.nadig@quintype>

If you have npm 5.x installed you can run npx covgen <your_email_address> instead of installing globally.

For subsequent projects, simply repeat the second command.

You may want to add language similar to this to introduce your code of conduct:

    Please note that this project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct. By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

You may also use the permalinks given above to reference from your project home page.

Important! You must add a contact method to the placeholder in the document so that people know how to report violations.
